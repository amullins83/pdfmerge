# PDF Merge
.NET WPF desktop app using iTextSharp to merge PDF files.

# Build and Run
1. Open `PdfMergeDesktop.sln` in Visual Studio (any version with NuGet enabled).
2. Build with NuGet restore enabled (or install dependencies and then build).

# Contribute
I could use help writing tests for all the asynchronous functions.
